# SonarQube report (for version 2.2.0)
![SonarQube report](sonar.png?raw=true "SonarQube Report")

# VERSION 2.3.0

Fixed visual bug - when adding new orders fails, and user tries to add new route points - padding for input form just goes crazy. Added icons for both projects. Fixed a bug when DriverEndpoint returned empty field regarding drivers instead of '-' if there are none for given order. Changed conditions at which driver is counted as available/unavailable.
