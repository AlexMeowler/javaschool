# VERSION 0.0.8

Added route calculation for orders, using annealing imitation algorithm with some logistic restrictions. Added mapping for drivers and orders. Solved cycle problem (or at least I think so). Still have to add driver selection, validation, and then I can start working on driver page and move towards finishing the project.

# TODO

Implement driver selection, validation, driver page, etc etc
