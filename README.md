# SonarQube report (for version 2.2.0)
![SonarQube report](sonar.png?raw=true "SonarQube Report")

# VERSION 2.2.0

Added test to cover month change scenario and some cases for calculation drivers chain. Removed 'servlets' multi-module package with one module 'servlet' (because servlets has only one module inside it anyway). Added a few tests for orders-table project. Removed warning from IDE and SonarQube.

# TODO

Testing stuff.
