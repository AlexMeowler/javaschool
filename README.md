# VERSION 0.8.6

Now cars can be reassigned, however there are more restrictions, because original drivers set will not be changed, and therefore you can't select a car with lower shift length (it is unknown if this will be enough).

# TODO

Super last business logic detail remaining - month change check when assigning drivers and check month change on startup. After that I can do some small design update and after that I don't know. Tests? Documentation? Code refactoring?
