Java School Public Repository

# VERSION 0.0.5

Added users_info table, DAO and DTO with additional info about user(name, surname, hours worked etc). This table is mostly for car drivers info. Also created tables of other entities (like orders, checkpoints, cars and etc). However it's only MySQL Server-side change (no Java code yet).

# TODO

Add data validation. Start working on business-logic.
